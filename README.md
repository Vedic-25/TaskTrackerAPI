Setup Project Structure: 
Create a Java project using a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Set up your project directory structure with packages for different components
(controllers, services, repositories, models, exceptions, etc.)

Database Configuration:
Set up the SQL database connection using a library like JDBC or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate. Configure the database connection
parameters (URL, username, password) in a properties file.

Implement Task Model:
Creating  the Task entity class with appropriate annotations and validations.

Implement Task Repository:
Creating  the TaskRepository interface that extends JpaRepository.

Implement Task Service:
Creating  the TaskService class to handle logic and interactions with the repository.

Implement Task Controller:
Creating the TaskController class to define RESTful endpoints.

Error Handling:
Implement exception classes for different error scenarios. Use @ControllerAdvice to handle exceptions globally.

HTTP Status Codes and Response Messages:
Use appropriate status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500) and customize response messages in exception handlers and controller methods.

Data Validation:
Leverage annotations like @NotBlank, @NotNull, etc., for data validation in the model class.

Logging:
Configure logging using SLF4J and Logback. Add log statements to capture errors and important events.

Unit and Integration Tests:
Write JUnit tests for each layer of the application (controller, service, repository) and integration tests to test the whole flow.
